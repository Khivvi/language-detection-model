# language-detection-model
Created a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to detect languages such as English, Malayalam,  Hindi, Kannada, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Dutch, Arabic, Turkish, German,  Danish and Greek. Integrated it with a messaging service Twilio to let users interact with the service  agents better.
