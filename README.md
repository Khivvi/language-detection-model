# Language Detector

# This is a language detector model which can predict 17 different languages.

Created a Multinomial Naive Bayes model to detect languages such as English, Malayalam, Hindi, Kannada, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Italian, Russian, Swedish, Dutch, Arabic, Turkish, German, Danish and Greek. Integrated it with a messaging service Twilio to let users interact with the service agents better.
